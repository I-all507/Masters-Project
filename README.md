# Masters-Project
Contains my coded TaylorF2 waveform which I used throughout my Masters project: Easing the Hubble Tension with Neutron Star-Black Hole Love Sirens.
Included within this package are functions for creating Fisher information matrices and differentiation using numerical methods.

I will also add an Examples folder to show how the step-sizes used during finite differencing were calibrated.
